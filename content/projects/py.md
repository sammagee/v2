**TL;DR** — An online Python editor with realtime output, using the `Pyodide` interpreter through WebAssembly.

Py allows you to build and share your Python code without ever touching a native editor or command line — it works great on any device, including your tablet or phone!

At first, you'll see one of a set of random examples, but you can instantly start writing your own code. Once you're happy with your creation, you can hit the save button and send the copied link to your coworker, friend, or teacher, and they will see and be able to run your creation in their browser.

All of this is available without the need for anyone to install or fiddle with Python on their machine.
