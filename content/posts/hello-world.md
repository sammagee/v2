This will be my first official blog post. I’ve recently decided this could be a good idea for a few reasons.

### I built this shiny new website

Alright, let’s get the shallow point out of the way first. I’ve rebuilt and redesigned this website at least a dozen times, in several different frameworks and languages. This time, however, I feel as though I’ve done a better job at showcasing the different forms work, and I want my writing to be one such form.

I find it to be a good exercise to rebuild this website when I want to learn a new framework or language or design principle but don’t have a great idea for a project to do so. It enables me to find out how to do something that I already know in a territory that I’m not familiar with—which I believe to be a great learning method.

I also want to document some of these topics that I’m learning, in the hopes that maybe it will help someone else; but if nothing else, it will serve as a good notebook for myself. 

### Writing can be healthy

Okay, I’ll admit it. I’ve never really written just for fun or for anything really other than schoolwork, emails, Slack messages, texts, or IMs. Maybe I wrote an occasional journal entry back when I was forced to or a random tech article when I thought I would make it big as the next tech blogger (*I still believe*), but I’ve never really done it just for myself.

I do think writing is an amazing skill and tool to have, especially when needed in a professional environment, but really in order to have good communication in general. I can’t be sure, but at this point I think writing the occasional post will help build and develop this skill

### Opinions are important
Prior to the past few years, I never really had strongly formed opinions about many important topics. More recently
